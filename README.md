# PhysEngine
A basic physics engine. More to come :3

## Running the engine
CMake is used for build.

SDL2 render
- Download SDL2-devel-2.28.5-mingw.zip and extract contents to project directory (current version hardcoded in engine)

Particle Data
- Change FILE_PATH to the name of the data file where you want to save the particle data.
- Run main.cpp to generate the data file.
- Run gnuplot on the data file to visualize it in 3d.

## TODO
- Refactor data file path stuff
